        <h2>History of the Vietnam Draft</h2>
        <p>
          The Vietnam War draft was managed by the United States Selective Service System and operated from 1964 to
          1973. Males between the ages of 18 and 26 were required to register for potential military service. In
          December 1969, the U.S. held its first draft lottery since World War II, using birth dates to assign draft
          order. This system was intended to streamline the selection process and ensure fairness. Individuals
          selected
          were required to serve in the military unless they qualified for deferments or exemptions, such as for
          education, medical reasons, or certain family circumstances. Approximately 2.2 million men were drafted
          during
          the Vietnam era, with the majority serving in the Army. The draft officially ended in 1973 when the U.S.
          transitioned to an all-volunteer force.

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

        <h4>Q1: How did the draft lottery system actually work in terms of birth dates and numbers?</h4>
        <p>
          Each day of the year was assigned a random number from 1 to 366. Men with birthdays assigned lower numbers
          were called to service earlier. For example, if July 9 was drawn as number 1, men born on July 9 were the
          first to be drafted.
        </p>

        <h4>Q2: What types of deferments or exemptions were commonly granted during the Vietnam draft?</h4>
        <p>
          Common deferments included student deferments (for those in college), medical deferments, and hardship
          deferments (such as being the sole provider for a family). Some were also exempt due to employment in
          essential civilian occupations or for religious reasons.
        </p>

        <h4>Q3: What was the process for someone once they were draftedâ€”what happened next?</h4>
        <p>
          Once drafted, individuals received an induction notice and were required to report to a local induction
          center. There, they underwent a physical examination and evaluation. If deemed fit for service, they were
          assigned to a military branch, typically the Army, and sent to basic training before being deployed.
